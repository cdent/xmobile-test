To make it go. For now. This will change as the database
evolves.

sqlite3 /tmp/xmobile.db < table.sql
./mkinstance foo
cd foo
ln -s ../mangler.py .
ln -s ../tiddlywebplugins .
echo "import mangler" >> tiddlywebconfig.py
twanager server &
# go to http://0.0.0.0:8080/bags/xmobile/tiddlers

You need to have the following tiddlyweb stuff:

tiddlyweb
tiddlywebwiki (and the many dependencies)
tiddlywebplugins.mappingsql

Have a look at tiddlywebplugins/xmobile/__init__.py for some
configuration defaults. The 'open_fields' stuff is a klingon
from wiki-data and its auth requirements, and will change
eventually.
