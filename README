xmobile-test is a prototype of a suite of tools for prototyping
a reporting, review and annotation interface for engineering
reports.

This is special purpose code that may or may not be of value.

It uses TiddlyWeb and TiddlyWiki plugins to create a datastore
and UI. To make the server run you needs to install the following
Python packages (and their dependencies):

* tiddlywebwiki
* tiddlywebplugins.diststore
* tiddlywebplugins.mappingsql

Then to establish a working server, from within the Git repository
run the following commands:

    # create a sample db
    sqlite3 /tmp/xmobile.db < table.sql
    # create a TiddlyWeb instance
    ./mkinstance foo
    # change into that directory and link in code
    cd foo
    ln -s ../mangler.py .
    ln -s ../tiddlywebplugins .
    echo "import mangler" >> tiddlywebconfig.py
    # start the built in web server
    twanager server &
    # go to http://0.0.0.0:8080/bags/xmobile/tiddlers

Have a look at tiddlywebplugins/xmobile/__init__.py for some
configuration defaults. The 'open_fields' stuff is a klingon
from wiki-data and its auth requirements, and will change
eventually.
